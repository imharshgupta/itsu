  IIEST, Shibpur owes its origin to the erstwhile <strong><a href="https://www.iiests.ac.in/">Bengal Engineering College</a></strong>, the history of wcich goes to the nineteenth century when industries in the sense we understand today, were practically absent. Prompted by the idea of meeting the requirement of trained engineering personnel for the Public Works Department, the then council of Education, Bengal, decided to open Civil Engineering classes and a Professorship in Civil Engineering was created at Hindu College, Calcutta, in the year 1843-44. A college of engineering was started by the name of Civil Engineering College on <strong> 24th November, 1856,</strong> in the premises of the Writers Building, Calcutta.
